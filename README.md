BMSSP - Bounded multi-source shortest paths.

## Abstract

We give a deterministic O(mlog2/3n)-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the O(m+nlogn) time bound of Dijkstra’s algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra’s algorithm is not optimal for SSSP.

## Development Details

This project is mainly focused in Javascript in order to be published to npmjs.com as a JS module (esmodule).
